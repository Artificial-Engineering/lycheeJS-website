# Boilerplate

The Boilerplate is the Getting Started point for each
project made with lychee.js and is compatible for use
with the lychee.js Editor.

It also features the integrated adaptive layouting stack,
the evented user interface and the evented networking
stack. Everything in the Boilerplate is understandable
by our software bots and can be optimized by them later.
